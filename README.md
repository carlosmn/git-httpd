Git-backed web server
=====================

This allows you to serve websites directly from the git repository,
without having to worry about deployment.

Specially useful if your gh-pages branch needs a web server, because
it relies heavily on javascript to work and you have better things
than switching to that branch or don't want to publish the branch yet
(testing docurium, for example)
