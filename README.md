Git-backed web server
=====================

This allows you to serve websites directly from a branch in a git
repository, without having to worry about deployment or switching to
that branch.

Specially useful if your gh-pages branch needs a web server, because
it relies heavily on javascript to work and you don't want to publish
the branch yet (testing docurium, for example)
